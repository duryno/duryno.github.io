                            There's a bit of a steep learning curve but once the user gets to understand the visualisations,
                            they're fairly easy to read and informative

                    <li>
                        What I'd like to be able to build at the end of this course is a dashboard similar to the one in Google Analytics which will display stats
                        relevant to content of the travel startup I'm building. Specifically, it should be possible to display the number of views of a particular attraction
                        during a specified time period (with days being the smallest unit), number of likes/dislikes of the attraction, its average rating, average time
                        spent by the user at the attraction's page, number of photos and stories related to the attraction, etc.
                        Similarly, it should be possible to display similar data for stories that the users can write.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The visualisation should describe the engagement of users of all apps (web and Android) in one place. Moreover, it shall show patterns
                        in user behaviour and popularity of places/stories in relation to others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The dashboard described above should be used primarily by myself, others involved in the company, and the company partners. This means
                        most users are expected to have a pretty good understanding of the platform and of the visualised data.

                <br/>

                <p>
                    In my job, I have many years of experience working with student statistics. I usually work with
                    data from student administrative IT-systems, as well as data from Statistics Denmark. Until now
                    I have created most of my graphics with ggplot in R and tables with excel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All leaders in my organization talk about data driven organisations. They want BI-tools to make better visualizations.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    I would like to learn the basics of interactive visualization. I know that making graphics with the possibilities of filtering will help. In addition, I also want to bring movement in to the visualizations.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <ol>
                    <li>I could take data from Statistics Denmark. There are data on education with both geography, time
                        series, education type. I know these data quite well. It could be data from the tables
                        <a href="www.statistikbanken.dk/HFUDD20">www.statistikbanken.dk/HFUDD20</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The story would deal with what the young people in Denmark are doing. How are they geographically
                        distributed combined with their educational activity, and how has these patterns changed over time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The intended audience is the people working with higher education in all parts of Denmark.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I know that visualizations needs to be simple for my audience. By including interactivity,
                        it gives me more tools. I will start using filtering and a few more motions. But if I get inspired during the course I could try more advanced visualizations.
