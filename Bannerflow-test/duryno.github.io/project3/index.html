                In this section, we present some of the choices we have made when designing the family tree presented above and a brief reasoning behind these choices.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Circles</h3>
            <p>
                We present each person as a circle. The name of the person is inserted in the middle of the circle. This keeps the text label inside the circle element and prevents it from interrupting with the paths between the persons. The person circles are coloured based on the generation they belong to. The horizontal position also represents the generation.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Connected Circles</h3>
            <p>
                Connected circles indicate a partnership, most commonly marriage. If a person has had more than one partner, as is the case of Donald Trump, this notation might be a bit confusing. However, we did not come up with a better solution that would not significantly increase the complexity of the implementation.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Paths</h3>
            <p>
                We wanted to show all parent-children links between the persons. Every child has links to both parents. Is it then clear who the two parents are.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Interactivity</h3>
            <p>
                The implemented tree provides some simple interactive functionality. When hovering over a circle representing a
                family member, a photo together with a short bio (copied from Wikipedia when available) of the given person appears from
                the bottom of the screen. This serves as a rather simple example of how interactive features can increase
                the usefulness of such trees and provide the viewer with an overall more pleasant experience.
