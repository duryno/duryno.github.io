            <p>In our group we have worked with two different types of visualisations based on the temperature data from NASA.</p>
            <p>
                The first part, unlike the latter one, shows a visualisation not directly related to climate change. Here we explore
                other parts of the d3-code and use of the radial scale for the cyclic nature of the months.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part deals with the focus area of "climate change", as described in the project scope. This visualization
                is made from the ground using the d3-book as a very handy guide. We have both worked with the javascript code.
                During the work we faced some challenges with the organization of the dataset used in d3. Therefore we have 3
                illustrations that illustrate how we work with this part.

        <p>
            The plot on the left-hand side is made in d3. Here, the dataset was reorganised in R prior to the import to d3. All data
            points were now placed in one column and time ordered. That made it possible to make a path through all
            the points as we can see in the R-plot below. The x-scale is a time-date scale.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Organisation of the Dataset</h3>
        <p>
            The organisation of dataset prior to d3-plotting is a very important issue, that we would like to address and
            learn more about during the rest of the course. It sets a lot of limits for the visualizing process later.
            Maybe it is just a matter of time before we learn how to manage that initial step in javascript.
